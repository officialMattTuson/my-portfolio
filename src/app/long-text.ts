export const mockMessageOne = `In the realm of bits and bytes, a software engineer's life is a symphony
of logic and creativity. Each day, they embark on a journey through
lines of code, weaving solutions and breathing life into digital
landscapes. Their mornings often begin with a cup of hot coffee, the
fuel for tackling complex algorithms and debugging intricate problems.
As the sun rises, so does the hum of their keyboards, accompanied by the
rhythmic clatter of ideas being transformed into reality. The debugging
dance can be both frustrating and exhilarating, as they chase elusive
bugs through the labyrinthine maze of their codebase.`;

export const mockMessageTwo = `Collaboration is the heartbeat of their world. Slack channels, pull requests, and code 
reviews are the threads that connect them with fellow engineers, bridging gaps in knowledge and fostering innovation. 
Teamwork turns challenges into triumphs as they collectively build software that shapes industries and changes lives. 
And yet, solitude also has its role. The quiet moments of deep focus, where lines of text transform into elegant solutions, 
are a software engineer's sanctuary. The thrill of seeing a project come to life, from a simple concept to a complex system, 
is the reward for their dedication.`;

export const mockMessageThree = `Continuous learning is their guiding star. The tech landscape evolves rapidly, and a 
software engineer's journey is a perpetual cycle of adapting, growing, and mastering new tools. Online courses, 
conferences, and open-source contributions are their compass, guiding them toward the next adventure. Amidst the 
lines of code and late-night coding sessions, software engineers find balance. They embrace the joy of solving puzzles, 
the satisfaction of creating something impactful, and the camaraderie of a community that spans the globe. Life as a 
software engineer is a tapestry of innovation, challenges, and the boundless potential of ones and zeros.`;
